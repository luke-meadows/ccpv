            &ldquo;TULU have known and worked with CCPV for years now, and we
            cannot recommend their services highly enough. We thoroughly enjoy
            working alongside Cam and his team at CCPV, and feel they are a
            vital element to our marketing department!&rdquo;

            Music and live event videography is something of a speciality of
            ours. Our founder is passionate about this space, so it seemed only
            natural to combine our knowledge with the passion and energy that
            only comes with the vibes of a live audience. We know that any good
            live event must generate electricity and energy to connect the
            members of the audience to what they&apos;re seeing first-hand. We
            work closely with event organisers and venue staff to capture this
            atmosphere so that anyone watching the footage can experience the
            same immersion that brought that group of people together at that
            particular point in time. When it comes to music and live event
            photography, we utilise a range of specialised, state-of-art
            equipment to capture everything from the beating heart of a crowd to
            the seemingly minute moments that would often be missed with a blink
            of an eye.
